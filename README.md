# Python_Projects
A repository for all of my python projects that I am currently doing. 

# Why the scaffold_dump branch was added 
Hi there. I added a new branch called scaffold_dump where I would be experimenting with 
the .dump() function from python's pickle module. Currently am finishing up on a project
that will allow you to save a considerable amount of money for each week. So far so good!
